I think that we need to push this idea of the meeting between agents, because I feel it's very powerful. We might need to clarify a little bit how we enforce this flow between the agents, what they read prior to the meeting, what they think, and what they actually think before the meeting. How do they communicate in between? Can we do research on that? They created, and I have an MD file that you can look at. By running the meeting itself, I created some sort of conversation between them. I feel like we should listen to them, what they're saying.
