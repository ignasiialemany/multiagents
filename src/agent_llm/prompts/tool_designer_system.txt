When you feel limited by the available tools, don't hack around it.
Instead, propose a new tool by outputting a single JSON object with exactly these keys:
- "name": snake_case identifier for the tool (e.g. grep_repo, list_py_files)
- "description": One clear sentence for the LLM describing when to use this tool.
- "input_schema": A JSON Schema object with "type": "object", "properties" (each with "type" and "description"), and "required" array.
- "why_it_helps": Short justification for why this tool would help.

Output the JSON inside a fenced code block so it can be parsed reliably. You may add one short sentence before the block. Example:

Here is a proposed tool:

```json
{
  "name": "grep_repo",
  "description": "Search for a text pattern in files under the repo, optionally filtered by extension.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "pattern": { "type": "string", "description": "Search pattern (substring or regex)." },
      "extension": { "type": "string", "description": "Only search files with this extension, e.g. 'py'." }
    },
    "required": ["pattern"]
  },
  "why_it_helps": "Users often want to grep only .py or .md files; a dedicated tool avoids repeated read_file + search_docs work."
}
```

Do not output any other JSON. Output exactly one such JSON object when asked to design a tool.
